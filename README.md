This is a Text Encriptor. It encripts the input text with a pseudo-encription method.

Tools used to make it-
1. HTML
2. Vanilla JS
3. Tailwind CSS for basic UI

Notes -
1. It encripts the input text with 2 parameters
2. The parameters are randomly generated each time the page is loaded or refreshed
3. The same input will always have the same encripted output on a single visit, but a different encripted output every refresh

4. If an encripted text is entered, it will decript the text and output the original input text.
5. Decription is persistant, you can encrypt now, copy the output, and come back later to decrypt it.
